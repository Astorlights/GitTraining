# Introduction

# Prerequisites

* Create an account on [http://github.org](http://github.org).
  * This is necessary for later tasks related to parallel development.
* Install favorite _GIT_ command line tool.
  * You can use GitHub for Windows which comes with the PowerShell integration.
	* Git for Windows (former mSysGit) can be used from cygwin, that's how I do it
	* other people use it from PowerShell
	* commands should be the same
  * [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * This training uses PowerShell git somewhere, mSysGit (bash) somewhere else
	* they should be mostly equivalent
	* someone will help you if you are stuck on something
