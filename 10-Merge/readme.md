git-merge
=========

> Join two or more development histories together

We will start with warning from documentation:

> Warning: Running git merge with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

Let's all start with cloning testing repository to check merge on:

	git clone git@github.com:graywolf/test_merge_conflict.git
