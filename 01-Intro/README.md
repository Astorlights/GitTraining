# GIT Introduction

## Overview

* We will start with the GIT command line interface to give you understanding of _GIT_.
* We will do a brief overview of visual tools later.

## GIT Vision

* Commit early and often.
  * Benefit of doing so is that you can always return back to point where
    it makes sense (or perhaps just check the status 2 hours ago).
* Make it nice later.
  * Once you are done with your changes you can make them nicer before
    publishing.
  * _GIT_ strength is that you can reorganize commits later before making
    them public or sending them for code review.
