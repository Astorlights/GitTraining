Git TFS Shelvesets
==================

We can work with TFS shelvesets from git.

Listing existing shelvesets
---------------------------

List shelvesets, by default just yours using this command

	$ git tfs shelve-list

You can use:

* `--full` to get more informations
* `-u=all` to list shelvesets of all users, not just you

> I have no idea what happens when you have user named `all`.

Unshelve
--------

	$ git [-u=user] tfs unshelve shelveset_name branch_name

Unshelves shelveset onto new branch, which is automatically created from parent commit of the shelveset.

Shelve
------

	$ git tfs shelve shelveset_name

This command creates a shelveset with changes on current branch since last commit with is already in TFS.

More information
----------------

If you really need to use `git-tfs` more then you just learned, you should check documentation at [their github](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs).
